Version 0.13
------------

* Added a new validation mechanism instead of the Rule/OneOf-based one.

Version 0.12
------------

* Added ability to specify alternative rules (introducing `OneOf`, a sibling
  of `Rule`).  This functionality is also available in `one_of` with
  `as_rules=True`.

* The MongoDB-related requirements are now optional.

* Dropped official support for Python 3.3 in favour of 3.4.

* The InvalidKey exception now uses `repr()` to format invalid values.
