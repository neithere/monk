Version 0.13
------------

* Added a new validation mechanism instead of the Rule/OneOf-based one.

Removed (after deprecation):

* `unfold_to_list` (deprecated since 0.10)
* `unfold_to_list_of_dicts` (deprecated since 0.10)

Removed (without deprecation stage):

* `Rule` class is replaced with concrete validators.
* `OneOf` class is replaced with `Any` combinator.
* `any_value` shortcut is replaced with `Anything` validator.
* `any_or_none` shortcut is dropped.
* `canonize()` is replaced with `translate()`
* custom validators to be used within a `Rule` are replaced with stand-alone
  validators/mergers.
* mergers are integrated into stand-alone validators/mergers; therefore
  custom type-specific merger functions are dropped.
  The function `merge_defaults` has been radically simplified and
  it does not support `mergers` and `fallback` arguments anymore.

Deprecated:

* `one_of` shortcut is deprecated in favour of `Any` combinator.
* `in_range` shortcut is deprecated in favour of `InRange` validator.

Changed some details of behaviour:

* XXX TODO describe from tests (grep CHANGED)

Version 0.12
------------

* Added ability to specify alternative rules (introducing `OneOf`, a sibling
  of `Rule`).  This functionality is also available in `one_of` with
  `as_rules=True`.

* The MongoDB-related requirements are now optional.

* Dropped official support for Python 3.3 in favour of 3.4.

* The InvalidKey exception now uses `repr()` to format invalid values.
