Data manipulation

def merged(spec, data, value_processor=lambda x:x):

    Does not validate values. If `data` overrides a default value, it is
    trusted. The result can be validated later with
    :func:`~monk.validation.validate_structure`.

    Note that a key/value pair is added from `spec` either if `data` does not
    define this key at all, or if the value is ``None``. This behaviour may not
    be suitable for all cases and therefore may change in the future.

    :param spec:
        `dict`. A document structure specification.
    :param data:
        `dict`. Overrides some or all default values from the spec.
